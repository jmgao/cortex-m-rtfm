//! Real Time For the Masses (RTFM) framework for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers
//!
//! **IMPORTANT**: This crate is published as [`cortex-m-rtfm`] on crates.io but the name of the
//! library is `rtfm`.
//!
//! [`cortex-m-rtfm`]: https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rtfm
//!
//! The user level documentation can be found [here].
//!
//! [here]: https://japaric.github.io/cortex-m-rtfm/book/en/

//! Don't forget to check the documentation of the [`#[app]`] attribute, which is the main component

//! # Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
//!
//! This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.31 (2018 edition) and up. It *might*
//! compile on older versions but that may change in any new patch release.
//!
//! # Semantic Versioning
//!
//! Like the Rust project, this crate adheres to [SemVer]: breaking changes in the API and semantics
//! require a *semver bump* (a new minor version release), with the exception of breaking changes
//! that fix soundness issues -- those are considered bug fixes and can be landed in a new patch
//! release.
//!
//! [SemVer]: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! - `timer-queue`. This opt-in feature enables the `schedule` API which can be used to schedule
//! tasks to run in the future. Also see [`Instant`] and [`Duration`].
//!
//! [`Instant`]: struct.Instant.html
//! [`Duration`]: struct.Duration.html
//!
//! - `nightly`. Enabling this opt-in feature makes RTFM internally use the unstable
//! `core::mem::MaybeUninit` API and unstable `const_fn` language feature to reduce static memory
//! usage, runtime overhead and initialization overhead. This feature requires a nightly compiler
//! and may stop working at any time!
